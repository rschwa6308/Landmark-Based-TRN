# Landmark-Based-TRN (coming soon!)
A plugin for [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) that provides detection and analysis of topographical landmarks for use in ground-level terrain-relative navigation (by planetary rovers).

See the [assoscated paper](https://russ-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IEEE_AERO___Landmark_Based_TRN_on_Mars-POLISHED.pdf) for more details and an example analysis of Martian topography data.


**Note**: this repository is temporary and will soon be deprecated in favor of an official NASA repository (coming soon)
